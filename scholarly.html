      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
          GarT is a web application meant to help the everyday gardner that wants to get started to learn a few useful
          things about the trade. Using this app, you can select any course from the wide variety that is offered, in order
          to pick just the right one for what you want to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
          Of course, what fun is learning if there isn't a bit of competition involved. So in order to insert this new competitive
          element we also present a ranking of all our users, based on the number of courses they have completed. So pick up your tools
          and get on started with the learning. Make sure you get among the first top ten students of our online platform.

      <h2>Structure</h2>
      <p>
        In order to not mix up our functionalities we have separated the folder structure in two: front-end and back-end.
      </p>
      <p>
          The front-end presents a friendly GUI, build on technologies such as: HTML5, JavaScript and CSS3 meant to present all of our functionalities as clearly as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
          On the other hand, the back-end is where all the "nasty" stuff is happening. We created a NodeJS server, that uses a Mongo Database to store all data necessary
          for the smooth running of our application. 
      </p>
      <section id="Root">
        <!-- review? -->
        <h3><code> Front-end</code></h3>
        <p>
          To make our code as clean as possible, we separated the files used on the front-end side of things into five:
        <ul>
            <li>assets</li>
            <li>models</li>
            <li>pages</li>
            <li>scripts</li>
            <li>styles</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Each file in each folder serves to a specific type of functionality:
            <ul>
                <li>assets - This is where we keep all photos used in the project</li>
                <li>models - This is where all classes that are used when mapping our resources from the backend find themselves</li>
                <li>pages - This folder contains the HTML code for our statically generated elements in each page</li>
                <li>scripts - This is where JavaScript files that handle either requests or dynamic generation of HTML elements are</li>
                <li>styles - And finally, in styles is where all the magic that makes each page look awesome(at least by our tastes) is happening</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3><code> Back-end </code></h3>
        <p>
            The back-end is much simpler to put into words, as it has only two folders and 1 file that are absolutely necessary:
            <ul>
                <li>db</li>
                <li>models</li>
                <li>index.js</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            As is with the front-end, each folder in the back-end is meant for one thing, and one thing only:
            <ul>
                <li>db - This is where the db.js file is found, which is responsible for every interaction that the server needs to have with the database</li>
                <li>models - This folder contains all models that we use in order to map either responses from the database or request bodies</li>
                <li>index.js - Here is the birthplace of our server, which handles requests sent by the client</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Endpoints</h3>
        <p>Our back-end side of things exposes a series of endpoints, meant for being of service to the Client:
        </p>
        <p><b>GET</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>/Courses - returns all existig Courses</li>
            <li>/Courses?courseId=id - returns the course that has the _id === id</li>
            <li>/Courses?searchString="searchString" - returns the course for which either the author or the title bears some resemblance to the searchString</li>
            <li>/Users?username="username" - returns the user which has the Username "username"</li>
            <li>/Users?userRanking="username" - returns the ranking of the user with the Username "username" </li>
            <li>/Users/Rankings - returns the top 10 users of our platform</li>
        </ul>          
        <p><b>POST</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>/Courses - creates a new Course based on the request body</li>
            <li>/Users - creates a new User based on the request body</li>
            <li>/Users/login - logs a user in based on the request body</li>
            <li>/Users/Update - updates the count of how many courses the user has completed</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Request bodies</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Course: { title: "Course title", author: "Course author", materials: ['mat1', 'mat2', 'mat3'], tasks: ['task1', 'task2', 'task3'] } </li>
            <li>Users: { username: "Some Username", password: "Some Password", admin: false, coursesCompleted: 0 }</li>
            <li>Users login:  { username: "Some Username", password: "Some Password" }</li>
            <li>Users update course count: { username: "Some Username", coursesCompleted: 3 }</li>
        </ul>
