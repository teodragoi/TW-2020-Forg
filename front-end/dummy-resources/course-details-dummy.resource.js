        "Bulbs and Tubers - Begonia, Canna, Crocosmia, Dicentra spectabilis, Gladiolus, Liatrus Buy your spring planted, summer flowering bulbs now for best selection. Choose bulbs that are heavy for their size and free of blemishes. If you're looking for a specific color or flower type buy dahlias now. If you want a large dahlia as soon as you plant it, buy the plant later. You can also plant more than one tuber of Dahlia in one hole to get a bigger plant in its first year.",

        "Pruning-Many shrubs and perennial plants are pruned in February here in Zone 9 to encourage good form and flowering. These include: Buddleja (Butterfly Bush), Berberis, Fuchsias, Erigeron, Nepeta, Veronica, Lemon Verbena and more. This winter has been warmer than average. Shrubs that are a little less frost tolerant and are usually pruned in late March are already pushing growth. If your plants, such as Teucrium fruticans are pushing growth early, prune them now even though it is early to do so.",
        "Pest Management-Continue to manage snails, slugs, earwigs, and cutworms with bait or hand picking (toss into a bucket of hot soapy water). Dormant spray plants such as roses before new growth starts to push to avoid damaging the new growth. Spray Peaches and Nectarines one last time before bud break. Gophers and moles have their place in nature but in the garden...not so much.",
        "Tools- Clean tools and lightly oil wooden handles - Keeping gardening tools clean  helps them last longer. Best practice: Clean tools after each use."
